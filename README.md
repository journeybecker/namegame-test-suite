This test suite supports WillowTree's Name Game, hosted at https://willowtreeapps.github.io/TE-namegame-interview/

The suite is written in Javascript.
There are two options to run the tests - Cypress and Testcafe. Our preferred option is Cypress. The Testcafe version should only be used when the Cypress test is not an option.

- Learn more about Cypress at https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress
- Learn more about Testcafe at https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation
